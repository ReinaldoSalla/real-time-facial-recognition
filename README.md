This code uses the Viola-Jones algorithm for facial detection and the Face Recognition library for facial identification.

It was executed in a Raspberry Pi microcomputer. Hence, the Viola-Jones was necessary since RP has a limited processing power.

Face Recognition it's a excelent Python library for facial identification, because it has a very good accuracy, even when used in a real time system.
